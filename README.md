## Project Overview
This repository contains the end-to-end implementation of the Deep Learning & Generative AI course project.  
The project involves data exploration, classical machine learning models, deep learning models built from scratch, and fine-tuning of pretrained transformer models.  
Experiments are tracked using Weights & Biases, and model performance is evaluated using Macro F1 score.
